	abstract = {Using an equivalent circuit model to characterize the constant-current part of a charging/discharging profile, a model is developed to estimate the state-of-health of lithium ion batteries. The model is an incremental capacity analysis-based model, which applies a capacity model to define the dependence of the state of charge on the open circuit voltage as the battery ages. It can be learning-free, with the parameters subject to certain constraints, and is able to give efficient and reliable estimates of the state-of-health for various lithium ion batteries at any aging status. When applied to a fresh {LiFePO}4 cell, the state-of-health estimated by this model (learning-unrequired or learning-required) shows a close correspondence to the available measured data, with an absolute difference of 0.31\% or 0.12\% at most, even for significant temperature fluctuation. In addition, {NASA} battery datasets are employed to demonstrate the versatility and applicability of the model to different chemistries and cell designs.},

	abstract = {Aging assessment is critical for lithium-ion batteries ({LIBs}) as the technology of choice for energy storage in electrified vehicles ({EVs}). Existing research is mainly focused on either increasing modeling precision or improving algorithm efficiency, while the significance of data applied for aging assessment has been largely overlooked. Moreover, reported studies are mostly confined to a specific condition without considering the impacts of diverse usage patterns on battery aging, which is practically challenging and can greatly affect battery degradation. This paper addresses these issues through incremental capacity ({IC}) analysis, which can both utilize data directly available from on-board sensors and interpret degradations from a physics-based perspective. Through {IC} analysis, the optimal health feature ({HF}) and the state of charge ({SOC})-based optimal data profile for battery aging assessment have been identified. Four stress factors, i.e., depth-of-discharge ({DOD}), charging C-rate, operating mode, and temperature, have been selected to jointly characterize diverse usage patterns. Impact analysis of different stress factors through the optimal {HF} with the {SOC}-based optimal data profile from aging campaign experiments have generated practical guidance on usage patterns to improve battery health monitoring and lifetime control strategies.},

	abstract = {Incremental capacity analysis ({ICA}) is a favorable candidate for state of health ({SOH}) estimation of lithium-ion battery ({LIB}). Although abundant works have been carried out on the {ICA}-based methods, a comprehensive comparison of them to clarify the application boundary is still lacking. Moreover, more efficient method for extracting more informative features of interest ({FOIs}) for {SOH} estimation is less explored. Motivated by this, this paper performs a comparative study over the filtering-based and the voltage-capacity ({VC}) model-based {ICA} methods with respect to the {IC} fitting accuracy, robustness to aging and the computing cost. In this framework, a set of novel {FOIs} different from traditional ones are captured along with the parameterization of {VC} models. Comparative results reveal the optimality of revised Lorentzian {VC} model with three peaks ({RL}-{VC}-3) for both {LiFePO}4 ({LFP}) and {LiNi}1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 ({NCM}) battery. The mean relative errors of capacity modeling are 0.34\% and 0.15\%, respectively. The newly captured {FOIs} have been further validated with high linearities with the reference capacity, offering deep insights into more straightforward {SOH} estimation for {LIB}. Illustrative case studies suggest that particular {FOIs} can offer accurate {SOH} estimation with absolute error of 0.079\% and 0.661\% respectively for the {LFP} and {NCM} battery.},
